expressedAI is an Express-based server application designed to seamlessly integrate with OpenAI's API, providing an easy interface to interact with AI models for various applications.

## Features

- Easy integration with OpenAI's API.
- Scalable Express server setup.
- Customizable endpoint for receiving user queries.
- JSON response handling for client-server communication.

## Installation

To get started with expressedAI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mustafa-boorenie/expressedAI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd expressedAI
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the Express server on `localhost:3000`. The server can be accessed via HTTP client, such as Postman, or through your own frontend setup.

### Example

To send a user question to the server:

1. Use an HTTP POST request to `http://localhost:3000/userQuestion`.
2. Include a JSON payload in the request body:
   ```json
   {
     "userQuestion": "What is the capital of France?"
   }
   ```

The server will process the request using the OpenAI model and return the response.
